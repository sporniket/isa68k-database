# Database - Integer instructions

This table aims to capture key features of each instruction described in the Integer instruction section of the Programming Reference Manual, except for the coprocessor instructions, that will have a dedicated table.

The columns can be roughly organised in 5 groups : 
* The group "before describing up to 3 operands", mainly the key features of an instruction format, and a GUID
* 3 groups with the same set of columns -except one columns for the last group-, each describing an operand ; one of the operand is the "main" one, codified in the last fields (LSB side) of the opcode.
* The group "after describing up to 3 operands", with a short description, and some flags about which CPU support a given instruction format.

## Key features columns

> An instruction with at least one size specifier (one 'x' in ".b", ".w" or ".l" columns) must have a size specifier in actual use.

* Row ID : a GUID to identify an instruction format
* Mnemonic : the mnemonic of the instruction. "\*cc" mnemonics (e.g. "Bcc") MUST be expanded with condition code (e.g. "BEQ", "BNE",...). "cp\*" mnemonics are coprocessor instructions, that need a mapping to the actual mnemonic (e.g. "F\*" for embedded or standard FPU and "P\*" for embedded PMMU).
* Synopsys : The instruction synopsys, without operand size indicator.
* Opcode : A codified description of the operation code as 16 bits grouped into bitfields. Usually decomposed into 4.3.3.3.3 (from MSB, one group of 4 bits, followed by 4 groups of 3 bits). A variable value in the synopsys is represented with a letter repeated over all the positions occupied by the value. Especially, the two fields describing an "Effective Address" ("<ea>" in the synopsis) are codified as "eee.aaa", and when there are 2 effective address, the second one is codified "fff.bbb" (i.e the following letters of "e" and "a", respectively). Most of the time, the mapping of those letters between the synopsys and the opcode are obvious (I hope so).
* Supplemental Word #1 : when other words are needed beyond effective address encoding, this columns contains a description (preferably as bitfields like in the opcode columns)
* Supplemental Word #2 : like the previous column.
* Domain : RESERVED (may be removed)
* .b : flag, whether the instruction format can specify the operand size as byte.
* .w : flag, whether the instruction format can specify the operand size as word.
* .l : flag, whether the instruction format can specify the operand size as long word.
* Number of operands : number of operands for this instruction format.


## First operand

> Instruction format without operands leave those columns empty.

> Except for the "Operand 1" columns, other columns are usually flags to mark valid effective addresses for the instruction format. Occasionnally, some instruction formats need something more descriptive than just an 'x'

> There is a distinction between Immediate Data (implying unsigned) and signed value. (e.g. for "BRA" the operand is a signed value with a given width, and a byte there are excluded values)

## Second operand

> Instruction format with up to one operand leave those columns empty.

> Except for the "Operand 1" columns, other columns are usually flags to mark valid effective addresses for the instruction format. Occasionnally, some instruction formats need something more descriptive than just an 'x'

> There is a distinction between Immediate Data (implying unsigned) and signed value.

## Third operand

> Instruction format without operands leave those columns empty.

> Except for the "Operand 1" columns, other columns are usually flags to mark valid effective addresses for the instruction format. Occasionnally, some instruction formats need something more descriptive than just an 'x'

> Contrary to the first and second operand, there is no instruction format with an immediate signed value as third operand.
